      <h2>history</h2>
      <p>In Old English, a regular morning meal was called morgenmete,[3] and the word dinner, which originated from Gallo-Romance desjunare ("to break one's fast"), referred to a meal after fasting.[4][5] Around mid-13 century, that meaning of dinner faded away, and around 15th century "breakfast" came into use in written English to describe a morning meal.[2]</p>
